# IaC Microservices Deployment


## Introduction

This project is for learning purposes, in order to compare the level of complexity of the code when:
- deploying a microservice infrastructure *locally* versus *on the Cloud*;
- deploying a microservice infrastructure *without Kubernetes* versus *with Kubernetes*.

There are therefore four microservice infrastructures which will be deployed and compared:
- [Local infrastructure without Kubernetes](/tree/main/local-installation/without-kubernetes/);
- [Local infrastructure with Kubernetes](/tree/main/local-installation/with-kubernetes/);
- [Cloud infrastructure without Kubernetes](/tree/main/cloud-installation/without-kubernetes/);
- [Cloud infrastructure with Kubernetes](/tree/main/cloud-installation/with-kubernetes/).


## Tools used
